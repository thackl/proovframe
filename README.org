* proovframe: frame-shift correction for long read (meta)genomics

Gene prediction on long reads, aka PacBio and Nanopore, is often impaired by
indels causing frameshift. Proovframe detects and corrects frameshifts in coding
sequences from raw long reads or long-read derived assemblies.

Proovframe uses frameshift-aware alignments to reference proteins as guides, and
conservatively restores frame-fidelity by 1/2-base deletions or insertions of
"N/NN"s, and masking of premature stops ("NNN").

Good results can already be obtained with distantly related guide proteins-
successfully tested with sets with <60% amino acid identity.

It can be used as an additional polishing step on top of classic
consensus-polishing approaches for assemblies.

It can be used on raw reads directly, which means it can be used on data lacking
sequencing depth for consensus polishing - a common problem for a lot of rare
things from environmental metagenomic samples, for example.
 

** Installation

Proovframe is available from 
[[https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/proovframe/README.html][Bioconda]], and thus can
be installed with 
[[https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/installing-with-conda.html][conda]],
which will also install its dependencies.

#+begin_src sh
conda install -c bioconda proovframe
#+end_src

If you decide to manual install the package cloning the repository,
consider that it requires [[https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond][DIAMOND v2.0.3]] 
or newer (for mapping).

** Usage 

#+begin_src sh
# map proteins to reads
proovframe map -a proteins.faa -o raw-seqs.tsv raw-seqs.fa

# fix frameshifts in reads
proovframe fix -o corrected-seqs.fa raw-seqs.fa raw-seqs.tsv
#+end_src
